# RabbitMQ-vagrant
A simple vagrant box with RabbitMQ-Server.

## Getting started
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `vagrant up`

## Connecting to RabbitMQ-Server
# http://172.42.42.42:15672/
# use admin:admin  OR admin:password

Ensure that RabbitMQ-Server is not running on your machine before starting up, as there will be a port conflict. Vagrant will soon tell you :)
