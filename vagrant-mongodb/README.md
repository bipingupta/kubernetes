# MongoDB-vagrant
A simple vagrant box with MongoDB.

## Getting started
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `vagrant up`

## Connecting to MySQL
Host: `172.42.42.42`  
User: `admin`  
Password: `admin`  
Port: `27019`

mongo admin -u admin -p admin

Ensure that MongoDB is not running on your machine before starting up, as there will be a port conflict. Vagrant will soon tell you :)
